Introduction
Hey there! I'm Jonas Haile, a passionate 29-year-old Computer Science enthusiast currently pursuing my 4th semester as an AP Graduate in Computer Science. I have a keen interest in both Cybersecurity and Mobile App Development, particularly focusing on Jetpack Compose.

Education
AP Graduate in Computer Science: Currently in my 4th semester, where I've been delving deep into various aspects of computer science, including programming, software development methodologies, and system architecture.
Selective Courses
In my journey through my Computer Science program, I've chosen to specialize in two exciting areas:

Cybersecurity: I'm fascinated by the intricate world of cybersecurity, where every line of code and every system configuration can mean the difference between security and vulnerability. I'm learning about encryption, network security, ethical hacking, and best practices to secure digital assets.

Mobile App Development (Jetpack Compose): With the world going mobile-first, I couldn't resist diving into mobile app development. Specifically, I'm honing my skills in Jetpack Compose, the latest and greatest way to build beautiful and interactive Android apps. From UI design to data management, I'm exploring every aspect of creating compelling mobile experiences.
